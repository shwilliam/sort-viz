# Sorting visualization

> Straightforward animated visualization of common sorting algorithms

## Algorithms

- Bubble sort
  - Compares each element
  - Swaps individual elements until array is sorted
  - O(n^2) time
  - O(1) space

- Quick sort
  - Divide and conquer
  - O(n log(n)) time
  - O(log(n)) space
